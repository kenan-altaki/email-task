# Subject: Request for information on transaction flows for mobile fin-tech product

Dear Joe,

I hope this email finds you well. As we work towards integrating our component into your mobile financial application, it is crucial for us to have a clear understanding of the transaction flows within your app. This will allow us to optimize the integration and ensure a smooth user experience.

To help us do this, we need to know a few things:

1. How many different ways can people pay or get paid in your app?
1. Are the transactions similar or do they vary a lot?
1. If they vary, should we use different forms for different transactions or will one form work for everything?
1. How often do these transactions happen? And how are you expecting it to change in the future?
1. Do you need the transactions to appear in real-time (up-to-the-minute)? or will can there be a delay (up-to-date)?

This information will help us decide if we need to set up a special way for the transactions to happen in real-time or if a daily summary will work. The real-time option requires an effort to implement, and maintenance from our side and your technical team. While the daily summary option, will need you to upload it on a shared drive manually. The trade-off being how quickly the transactions are processed.

We understand that your project is on a tight budget, and we want to be mindful of costs while ensuring the best outcome for your app. By providing us with this information, we can work together to minimize any additional costs and ensure a seamless implementation.

We would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with this information by [insert deadline], as it is crucial for us to make the necessary decisions and stay on schedule.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,
Kenan
